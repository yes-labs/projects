# Yes Labs

## What is Yes Labs?

Yes Labs is a place for people interested in Scottish Independence to
discuss and collaborate on projects. If you:

 * Have an idea for a project that could help Independence
 * Are interested in using your skills to contribute to a project (design, development, stats, policy, copywriting, all skills welcome)
 * Are part of an independence group and would like help with web / tech related things

Then this is the place for you!

## How do I participate?

Visit our [https://github.com/yes-labs/projects/issues/](Github Issues) page, this
is where we are currently listing projects and discussing ideas. Please feel
welcome to open new issues if you have an idea for a project or something you
would like to discuss.

It is early days for Yes Labs and this is one of the main areas we will be working
on so very happy to hear suggestions for how you think it would be easiest to start
participating.

## Conduct

We have a [https://github.com/yes-labs/projects/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](Code of Conduct),
please check it out and understand we will be taking it seriously. Discussions about
politics can often get passionate so please take care to keep things on topic, be
sensitive to other peoples perspectives and try to give others the benefit of the
doubt. If you feel like anyone has crossed a line please email me at
[dale@arandomurl.com](dale@arandomurl.com) and it will be dealt with seriously and
confidentially.
